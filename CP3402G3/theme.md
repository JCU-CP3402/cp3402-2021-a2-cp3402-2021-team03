## Information of theme CP3402G3
This theme is developed by Zhanjie Peng and CP3402 G3 Team.</br></br>

## The Based theme
It is based on Theme Twenty-One and extends some page functions to realize our web design.

## Modification and features
We've added some new ideas to the header to allow it to display special colors, and we've also created a very creative Footer for our ASG-Australia website. Our page's main color is sky blue, the header of our site is mixed with skyblue and grey, and we've applied it to the default background.</br></br>

As a feature we also expanded the page size and changed some of the Button hover to suit our UI, this ensures that it will look good on different sites.</br></br>
We can ensure that each Article has a clean title, and the page can support the most of original Post browsing function of the Twenty-one theme.</br></br>

## files that would need editing
The page structure of our website has been done very well, there is no need to add more modifications in the Padding and Margin, and the future development should focus on the implementation of color configuration and buttons in different areas.</br>
